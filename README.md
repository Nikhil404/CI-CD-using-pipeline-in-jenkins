INSTALL JENKINS ON 18.04 AND SETUP CI-CD FOR PIPELINE FOR JAVA APPLICATION

To complete my project I started with installing Jenkins from the commands from Fig Jenkins
history.png and I checked the status using service Jenkins status to know the status. Later I
started the Jenkins from my localhost IP address like https://localhost:8080 which will give me
access to Jenkins host later by inserting the Jenkins administrative password we can set the
Jenkins.

Now after the Jenkins server is started, I established a connection with GitHub for continuous
integration and deployment for my project. For that, I used webhooks to push the changes made
to git repo for CI-CD of my project. Further Screenshots are provided.
